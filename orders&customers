Orders + Customers Script (3 speakers, equal split)
Speaker 1 (Orders Part 1 + Customers Part 1)
Slide 16–17: Orders (Part 1)

“Now we’re in Orders—this tells us demand: what people are ordering and how that demand behaves.

At the top, we’ve used summary cards to give a quick pulse:

Total Orders (5K) tells overall demand under the current filters.

Average Order Value (₹956.94) is calculated using a measure like:
AOV = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])
We use DIVIDE() so it stays safe even when filters create a zero-orders scenario.

Orders per Outlet (999.80) is a fairness metric: it normalizes orders by outlet count, so a city with more outlets doesn’t look “better” just because of scale.
Orders per Outlet = DIVIDE([Total Orders], DISTINCTCOUNT(DimOutlets[outlet_id]))

YoY Orders % (50.03%) compares performance to last year’s same period so seasonality doesn’t mislead us.
Typical approach: SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() with the date table.

Now look at Orders Over Time—we show Total Orders and Cumulative Orders together.
Total Orders shows the year-wise trend, while cumulative tells momentum—whether we’re consistently building volume over time, not just spiking randomly.”

Slide 18–19: Customers (Part 1)

“Switching to Customers, we again start with cards—quick health check of the customer base:

Total Customers (1K) is a distinct customer count, so repeat purchases don’t inflate customer count:
Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(DimCustomers[cust_id])

Average Rating (4.10) captures customer satisfaction, which impacts retention.

Now on the left: Top 3 Satisfied Customers.
We included this because loyalty programs and outlet teams need real names/segments to action—these are high-engagement customers worth retaining.
This visual is driven by a measure like Orders per Customer and sorted by rating/orders so it always stays correct under filters.”

Speaker 2 (Orders Part 2 + Customers Part 2)
Slide 17: Orders (Part 2)

“I’ll take the middle part of the Orders dashboard—where we explain what drives those order numbers.

First, notice the Category slicer (Chinese/Indian/Italian). We added it so stakeholders can instantly answer:
‘Is the growth coming from one cuisine type or overall demand?’
Because of our star schema, the slicer filters all visuals consistently through FactSales.

Now: Total Orders by Item Name.
This is a straight decision-maker chart—top ordered items drive inventory planning, prep priorities, and promotions.
We typically use a ranking/top-items approach (like RANKX) so the “top dishes” remain dynamic when filters change.

Next: Total Orders by Day.
This helps operations: staffing, kitchen load, and peak-day planning.
We used a trend/area chart because you can see volatility and peaks instantly—a table wouldn’t show that pattern as clearly.”

Slide 19: Customers (Part 2)

“On Customers, I’ll cover the Repeat Customer % (1.49) and the Customer Retention Trend.

Repeat Customer % is defined very cleanly:

Identify customers whose order count is greater than 1

Divide by total customers

Typical DAX pattern:

Orders by Customer = CALCULATE([Total Orders]) in customer context

Repeat Customers = COUNTROWS(FILTER(VALUES(DimCustomers[cust_id]), [Orders by Customer] > 1))

Repeat Customer % = DIVIDE([Repeat Customers], [Total Customers])

Now the Retention Trend chart shows Repeat Customer % along with Repeat Customer Orders.
We used both because % alone can mislead when the total customer base changes, and orders alone can mislead when volume changes. Together, they give a solid retention story that’s hard to “counter-question.”
For example, if repeat % drops but repeat orders are stable, it usually means new customers increased.”

Speaker 3 (Orders Part 3 + Customers Part 3)
Slide 17: Orders (Part 3)

“I’ll finish Orders with the segmentation and category contribution visuals.

Orders by Age Group answers: who drives volume?
We used age groups because business teams can act on it—targeted combos, offers, and timing campaigns.

Next: Total Orders and Total Revenue by City.
This is important because volume and value are different. A city can have high orders but lower revenue if baskets are smaller or items are cheaper.
That’s why we paired orders with revenue—to avoid misleading conclusions.

Finally: Orders by Category is a waterfall-style view.
The reason we chose this is it explains contribution step-by-step: which category adds to total orders and which pulls it down.
It’s not just “who is highest,” it’s “who changes the total and by how much.” That’s exactly what managers ask.”

Slide 19: Customers (Part 3)

“Now I’ll close Customers with behavior and value.

The AOC card (2)—Average Order Count—tells typical purchase frequency.
We calculate it as an average at customer level so a few heavy buyers don’t distort it:
AOC = AVERAGEX(VALUES(DimCustomers[cust_id]), [Orders by Customer])

Then we have Total Orders by Age (by exact ages).
This is more granular than age groups and helps detect patterns like: certain ages ordering consistently more.

Finally: Revenue by Age Group donut shows who brings money, not just orders.
We used this because the highest-order segment isn’t always the highest-value segment—this is what helps decide premium offers vs discount offers.”
