INTRO--

Behind the scenes, we built a data warehouse with dimensions for menu, outlets, customers, and staff. Think of it as our pantry—everything neatly organized for quick access.
 
**Slide 9 – Dataset Summary (Data Collection)**

To stock that pantry, we first collected four main “ingredients.”

One: **Items**—this is our menu hierarchy: category, sub-category, pricing, and cost. So every dish has a clear identity and a price tag.
Two: **Outlets**—where the food is being served: location details and operational age, so we can compare a new outlet versus an established one.
Three: **Customers**—demographics, visit frequency, and ratings, which helps us connect satisfaction with spending patterns.
And four: **Sales**—the most important one: transactional-level data with quantities and order totals—basically the “receipt” for every purchase.
 
*(Quick audience moment)* If you think about it, without clean receipts and clear labels, even the best chef can’t tell what’s selling… and what’s just taking up shelf space.
 
**Slide 10 – Data Warehouse Design (Star Schema)**

Next, we organized everything into a structure that’s perfect for analysis. At the center, we have **FactSales**—our logbook of what happened. Each row captures *who bought (customer), what they bought (menu item), where (outlet), when (sale date), and even who handled it (staff)*—along with the key numbers like counts and amounts.
Around it, our dimension tables—**DimMenu, DimOutlets, DimCustomers, and DimStaff**—work like labeled jars in the pantry. They hold the descriptive details, while FactSales holds the measurable “activity.” That separation is what keeps analysis fast, clean, and consistent.
 
**Slide 11 – Model View in Power BI (How it connects)**

And here you can actually see it working: each dimension connects *one-to-many* into FactSales. So when we filter by “one outlet,” “one category,” or “one customer group,” the model instantly shows the matching sales—no confusion, no messy joins.
This is also how we avoid double-counting and keep KPIs reliable when building DAX measures—because everything is connected through one trusted sales table in the middle.
 
So once this warehouse is in place, the dashboards you’re about to see aren’t just pretty charts—they’re pulling answers from a well-organized backend, in seconds.
 
Now, feast your eyes on these dashboards!
